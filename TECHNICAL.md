# CRM Provisioner - Technical

## JSON Schema for Resource Configuration Files

- Leverage JSON Schema for maintaining the integrity and structure of resource configuration files, ensuring consistency and facilitating automated validation.

## Restricting Changes

- Strict controls on modifications to resource files, allowing only additions or deletions of files corresponding to specific resource types. This restriction ensures a predictable and controlled evolution of the configuration.

## Adding Files via Command

- Introduce resource files exclusively through the command:
  ```shell
  yarn add-resource <crm_provider>/<resource_type> <resource_name>
  ```
This standardized command serves as a gatekeeper, promoting a unified approach to resource addition.

## Git Pre-commit Check
Implement a Git pre-commit hook to fortify code quality and schema adherence. This hook validates the schema of staged resource files, preventing erroneous configurations from being committed.
## GitHub Workflow - Schema Validation and Restriction
- GitHub workflow encompassing:
    - Schema validation of resource files.
    - Restriction of changes based on resource type.
This workflow executes with every pull request, upholding code quality and consistency throughout the development lifecycle.
## GitHub Workflow - Resource Deployment
- Sophisticated GitHub workflow orchestrating the deployment of resources into Emarsys using API calls. Key features include:
    - Secure retrieval of necessary tokens from AWS Secret Manager.
    - Activation post PR approval, ensuring a controlled deployment process.
## Post-Deployment Modifications
- Following a successful resource provisioning, the original file undergoes modification to incorporate additional information derived from the API response. This step enriches the local configuration with real-time data.
## Multi-Environment Provisioning
- PR ensures resource provisioning on both staging and production environments for comprehensive testing and validation. This approach guarantees the stability of configurations across different deployment scenarios.
Auto-Merge after Deployment
Upon the successful completion of all deployment processes, the PR undergoes an automated merging procedure. This seamless integration further streamlines the workflow, reducing manual intervention.
